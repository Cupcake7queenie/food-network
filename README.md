<h1>Hungry & Loaded - Fast Food Restaurant Website</h1>

 <p>
  Hungry & Loaded is a dynamic fast food restaurant website that brings together my skills in design, coding, and marketing. Built using HTML and CSS, with a touch of JavaScript to enhance interactivity, this project showcases my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. As my first public project, it reflects my journey as a self-taught programmer. It's a great way for employers and fellow developers to explore my skillset, and for businesses looking to hire someone who can build aesthetic, functional websites.
